# GrokkingAlgoirthmsExamples

In this repositry, I invest time in making Grokknig Algorithm Book Examples rewritten in Java. I take it a step further and I make sure to check every algorithm for ```built-in java functoins and implement interfaces like Clonable, Comparable, etc.``` to run the aglorithm against custom referencial datatypes and get it to work!
